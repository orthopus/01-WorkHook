## WARNING NOTICE BEFORE STARTING

The Do It Yourself (DIY) versions of our solutions are not CE marked. CE marking is only applicable to solutions developed and sold by ORTHOPUS because their design follows the current regulations. ORTHOPUS cannot guarantee the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of solutions replicated by third parties thanks to the documentation shared on github.



### D.I.Y LEVEL **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê**

**WARNING:** Making a DIY version of the hook can be quite complex and dangerous. These are the reasons why ORTHOPUS will not be sharing a MAKING MANUAL for the Work Hook here. But if you feel comfortable with the making process, please don't hesitate to ask us for the files.

However we share the 3D models of the different hook configurations and they can be found on the Work Hook repository [here](/src) with the corresponding [mechanical drawings](/src/DRW-0112-1xxx-WorkHook.pdf).
